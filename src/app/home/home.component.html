<p>
  This app uses Angular Material, and has an example of a basic mobile-first
  responsive container class called "container" that is in contained in the
  styles.scss file, and used to wrap the router outlet that is in the
  app-component component.
</p>
<p>
  There are 3 "Feature States" in this app; "app", "count", and "books".
  The "app" and "count" feature states follow their respective examples in
  links 3 and 4 below, from the RxJs web site.  The third one, I did
  on my own.  The pages for these are...
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Home (this page) - Basic NgRx Project</li>
  <li>User Profile (hamburger menu) - My Example</li>
  <li>Books (hamburger menu) - Intermediate NgRx Project</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Links 1 and 2 are for Youtube videos that explain what NgRx is and it's
  features.  Link 1 is a short and high level description of NgRx.  Link 2
  is a deeper dive into how to write actions, reducers, and selectors.  It
  gives a lot of information for the length of the video.
